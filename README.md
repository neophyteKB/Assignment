# Assignment

# Overview

This project implements the News Reader App, focusing on the core requirements from the shared document. The app provides functionality to browse news articles, read details, and bookmark favorites for later.

# Architecture

**MVVM Architecture:** The app follows the MVVM pattern to separate concerns. While functional, thereâ€™s scope for refinement and optimization.

**Thread-Safety:** View, ViewModel, and Model conform to Sendable for modern concurrency and thread safety.
# Key Features

**Local Database with SwiftData:** Bookmarks are stored locally using SwiftData. It was a learning opportunity and an area I plan to refine further.

**View Composition:** Code is modular, with large views split into smaller components and reusable functions.

**Unit Tests:** Experimented with unit tests using Swift Testing, though the coverage can be improved.

# Limitations & Future Scope

**Pagination:** Not implemented; this feature can be added in the future.

**Concurrency:** The app uses both modern concurrency and Combine. This could be streamlined for better consistency.

**Network Layer:** Could be simplified and optimized for better clarity.

# Challenges

* Balancing this assignment alongside family commitments and work meant some areas were rushed.
* Despite this, I aimed to deliver a functional app and welcome feedback to address any gaps.

# Extras

**Medium Articles:** Iâ€™ve written articles with significant readership. Check them [here](https://medium.com/@kkbhardwaj20).

**Cover Letter:** View my sample [here](https://github.com/neophyteKB/Profile/blob/main/CoverLetter.md). Itâ€™s still evolving! ðŸ˜‰
